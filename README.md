# Rocket Examples

This repository provides a collection of examples demonstrating the use of the [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) web framework in Rust. Each example showcases different features and capabilities of Rocket, serving as a practical reference for developers.

## Examples

1. **Hello Rocket**: A basic example that sets up a simple web server responding with "Hello, Rocket!".
2. **Hello Rocket Async**: An asynchronous version of the "Hello Rocket" example, illustrating how to handle asynchronous requests.
3. **Route Implementation**: Demonstrates various routing techniques, including parameterized routes and handling different HTTP methods.
4. **Bookstore Project**: A simple REST API simulating a bookstore, showcasing CRUD operations with Rocket.


## Getting Started

To run any of these examples, ensure you have Rust installed on your system. If not, install it using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/X0rD3v1L/rocket-examples.git
cd rocket-examples
```

Navigate to the desired example directory and run it using Cargo:
